  "description": "He graduated early from the science department, acquired his PhD at a record speed, and is now a senior researcher making a large salary at a major company. In other words, Go Youngwon is a pitiful engineering student that has never been outside his school or the lab. Just like his name, he dreams about love and forever ever after. But, he’s actually a sucker for looks and falls in love quickly. Because of this bulldozer-like personality, he often gets dumped before he even starts dating. Meanwhile, the guy he’s been stuck with lately is... Kang Hyunwoo, a man of the same age, and who has the exact opposite temper, tastes, personality, and basically everything else.",
